# Every night between 7pm and midnight, two computing jobs from two different sources are randomly started with each one lasting an hour.
# Unfortunately, when the jobs simultaneously run, they cause a failure in some of the other companyâ€™s nightly jobs, resulting in downtime for the company that costs $1,000. 

# The CEO needs you to tell her the annual cost of this issue.
