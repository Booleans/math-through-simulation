# Every night between 7 PM and midnight, two computing jobs from two different sources are randomly started with each one lasting an hour.
# Unfortunately, when the jobs simultaneously run, they cause a failure in some of the other companyâ€™s nightly jobs, 
# resulting in downtime for the company that costs $1,000. 

# The CEO needs you to tell her the annual cost of this issue. Write a simulation to approximate the annual cost.

# If the difference between start times is <= 20% of the interval then there's an overlap.
